### What is the project attempting to deliver and how did you deliver it?
This project is aiming to deliver a representation of the variable font called movement. Showcasing each of its variations through design and information. Showcasing the different weight and space each letter and symbol can offer.
### What did you learn?
I learned different animations of the variations, making sure we have the right asset put into our code. How different colors interact with one another. Span tags so that in the same line of text some words can be one font, color and have an animation and another set of words and have no animation, different color, and font.
### What makes your project stand out?
If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a "Features" section and listing them here.
What made my project stand out the most is the different complementary colors on the cool tone backgrounds, having a hero section where some of the words in the line of text are animated and the others are not. Also having a svg in the background that corresponds with the colors of the hero section and the font showing off the formation of the letters itself. Having animations on both the instagram and the download button.
### How did you create your mock-ups
Created my mock up by image tracing the dancers movements to create silhouettes of them and overlaid the font letters that they were tracing in the dance.
